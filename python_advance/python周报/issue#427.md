[Bootstrapping Understanding: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/bure.html) 
Reverse engineering an unfamiliar data file could be described as the bootstrapping of understanding. In many ways the process resembles the scientific method, only applied to human-made, abstract objects instead of the natural world. You begin by gathering data, and then you use that information to put forth one or more hypotheses. You test the hypotheses, and use the outcome of those tests to refine them. Repeat as needed. Developing skills in reverse engineering is largely a matter of practice. Through an accumulation of experiences, you build up an intuition of where to investigate first, what patterns to look for, and what tools to keep handy. This post walks through the process of reverse-engineering some data files from an old computer game, in order to show you a little bit of how it's done.

[Python Tips and Trick, You Haven't Already Seen](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/1)
There are plenty of articles written about lots of cool features in Python such as variable unpacking, partial functions, enumerating iterables, but there is much more to talk about when it comes to Python, so here I will try to show some of the features I know and use, that I haven't yet seen mentioned elsewhere.

- [Part 2](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/4) - Here comes another round of Python features that you hopefully haven't seen yet.

[Optimized human learning - London, UK](https://www.meetup.com/LondonPython/events/266632570/)
Spaced repetition, the testing of knowledge over a period of time, is one of the most important tools we know of in the science of learning. Modern technology, in the form of spaced repetition software like Anki, promise to take this to the next level by offering personalized learning schedules for each individual learner — but often underdeliver. In this talk, Jacob Puthipiroj walks through an implementation of spaced repetition scheduling via machine learning, the first of its kind in a commercially available software.
