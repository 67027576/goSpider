**[使用Python扩展Clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQPW16_jixs)** ![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e2e180baf855ac797ef407fc7/images/8def3887-e9e9-4a48-95e0-74045a6a23fc.png)*(30min)*

`Libpython-clj`是一个库，它允许您使用`clojure repl`中的`python`库。我们将仔细研究使程序库工作的细节，并讨论构建它的设计决策的一些潜在后果。



**[使用 TensorFlow 构建一个  AI-Empowered Music 库](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/01/building-ai-empowered-music-library-tensorflow.html)**



QQ Music is a music streaming service owned by the Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME) and we serve 800M+ users globally. We have a massive music library with an extensive collection of albums and live music available in both audio and video formats. Building upon TensorFlow, we are able to effectively manage the music library by implementing many machine learning algorithms for automatic music tagging, music evaluation, voice separation, music defect detection and restoration, and so on. In this article, we’d like to share with you how we have built such an AI-empowered music library and our experience of using TensorFlow.

[Reading Binary Data with Python](https://reachtim.com/articles/reading-binary-data-with-python.html)
When you deal with external binary data in Python, there are a couple of ways to get that data into a data structure. You can use the ctypes module to define the data structure or you can use the struct python module. You will see both methods used when you explore tool repositories on the web. This article shows you how to use each one to read an IPv4 header off the network.

[Stopping Python-based Backdoor Attacks](https://vimeo.com/383337193/65c5e52bcd) ![img](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/e2e180baf855ac797ef407fc7/images/8def3887-e9e9-4a48-95e0-74045a6a23fc.png)
The MechaFlounder was a backdoor attack linked to Iranian threat actors who targeted Turkish entities. Similar Python-based backdoor attacks have managed to evade traditional network security defenses and propagate inside their target environments. Learn about Python-based backdoor attacks and why protection based on software-identity verification (zero trust security) can stop such attacks.

[Real-time Object Detection with Phoenix and Python](https://www.poeticoding.com/real-time-object-detection-with-phoenix-and-python/)
This article is not just about Machine Learning and Object Detection, it’s about Elixir interoperability and how we can take advantage of the Python’s fantastic set of ML libraries, bringing their features into the Elixir world.

[URLs Lead The Way](https://www.mattlayman.com/understand-django/urls-lead-way/)
How does a Django site know where to send requests? You have to tell it! In this next article in the Understand Django series, we look at URLs and how to let your users get to the right place.

[Helping IT Govern the AI/ML Ecosystem](https://hubs.ly/H0mGnnr0)
Learn how Dell and Domino created a refreshingly simple approach to help companies get their data science teams and the technologies they need up and running faster, with an easy path to scale. SPONSOR

[Intro to anomaly detection with OpenCV, Computer Vision, and scikit-learn](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/01/20/intro-to-anomaly-detection-with-opencv-computer-vision-and-scikit-learn/)
In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform anomaly/novelty detection in image datasets using OpenCV, Computer Vision, and the scikit-learn machine learning library.

[Automate Boring Tasks With Your Own Functions](https://t.co/l9jWcdLESU) 
Automating tasks with Python is easy. Once you have a script that works, turn it into a function that will help you code more efficiently!

[Drawing with Ants](http://amydyer.art/wp/index.php/2020/01/01/drawing-with-ants-generative-art-with-ant-colony-optimization-algorithms/)
Generative Art with Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms.

[Parens for Pyplot](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2020/01/18/parens-for-pyplot/)
libpython-clj has opened the door for Clojure to directly interop with Python libraries. That means we can take just about any Python library and directly use it in our Clojure REPL. But what about matplotlib? Matplotlib.pyplot is a standard fixture in most tutorials and python data science code. How do we interop with a python graphics library?

[Measure Code Execution Time Accurately in Python](https://knasmueller.net/measure-code-execution-time-accurately-in-python)
Measuring code execution times is hard. Learn how to eliminate systematic and random measurement errors and obtain more reliable results.

[Codemodding Python: unittest asserts to Python asserts](https://t.co/8lvTXgfzOb) 
Large codebases require continued maintenance, but it is time-consuming and cumbersome to change portions of code scattered around many files. This article shows how to write codemods to refactor Python code using its Abstract Syntax Tree — gaining far more granular control than basic regex and search-replace.

[open and CPython](http://hondu.co/blog/open-and-python)
Misusing Python’s open and the interaction of CPython’s GC and UNIX semantics can lead to unexpected results!
